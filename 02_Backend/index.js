/* Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, 
and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. */

// Node.js is used to create a http (client side) server (Hyper text transfer protocol)!!

/* HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules 
for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on 
the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly uses HTTP */
